description: Requirements and setup instructions for running doubleespresso-films locally
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
- **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**: Package manager of your choice
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Environment variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

### Google Analytics (optional)

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Set this in `app/lib/gtag.js` or as an environment variable to enable Google Analytics tracking.

### API endpoint

The application connects to a Strapi CMS backend at:

```
https://admin.doublekava.watch/api/cards?populate=*&pagination[pageSize]=1000
```

If you're running your own Strapi instance, you'll need to update the API endpoint in `app/components/films-list/Films.tsx`.

## Installation steps

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/partykino-org/doubleespresso-films.git
cd doubleespresso-films
```

### Install dependencies

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
bun install
```

### Configure environment

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (optional):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-ga-id
```

## Running locally

### Development mode

Start the development server with Turbopack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

```bash
bun dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Production build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Linting

Run ESLint to check code quality:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Verification

After starting the development server, verify the installation:

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
2. You should see the film catalog homepage
3. The page should load films from the API (if the backend is accessible)
4. Try searching and sorting films to ensure functionality works
